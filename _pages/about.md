Hi! My name is Miguel Brandao and I'm a Portuguese Computer Science and Engineering major, I've attained my master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Universidade da Beira Interior.

My studies focus mainly in Artificial Inteligence, Secure Software, Blockchain technology and Parallel and Distributed Computing. However I'm interested in many more fields.

I am currently a Senior Developer @ Softinsa - IBM, where I do back-end development and occasional front-end work. I'm always interested in hearing about new opportunities so don't hesitate to contact me through LinkedIn or my email.
