Hi! My name is Miguel Brandao and I'm a Portuguese Computer Science and Engineering major, I've attained my master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Universidade da Beira Interior.

My studies focus mainly in Artificial Inteligence, Secure Software, Blockchain technology and Parallel and Distributed Computing. However I'm interested in many more fields.

I am currently looking for work or to partner in any project related with my field, so if you have anything to discuss send me an email or contact me trough LinkedIn.
