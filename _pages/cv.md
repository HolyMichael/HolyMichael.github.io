About Me

I enjoy all aspects of software development, from planning all the way to the polishing stage. Throughout all the projects I was a part of, either towards my computer science and engineering degree or as freelance work I have usually undertaken the role of organizing the team and setting them on a good path towards the goal. Despite this, in the grand majority of times, I also needed to help with the developing process be it by helping/mentoring others complete their tasks or completing tasks on my own. As such in the end, I always tend to know the project as a whole and this is crucial during the documenting stages. I'm very interested in my field and if something is unknown to me, I attempt to learn it by enlisting the help of others or by researching it myself. This need also led me to be helpful in other times of need and to fit well within most teams I come across.
